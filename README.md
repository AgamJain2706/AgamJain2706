# Agam Jain
Hey there! I'm Agam ðŸ‘‹, a front-end magician transforming chai  into code. Passionate about building sleek, user-friendly digital landscapes. With my toolbox of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a sprinkle of Python, I've been part of creating some cool web spaces like Sneakersphere and Devtown. Born curious, I'm always on a quest to learn and have added Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++, and a bit of PHP to my skill collection.

My journey started with a Udemy course on HTML in December 2022, and it didn't stop there. Fast forward a few months, and I'm now certified in CSS, C, and C++, with a special spotlight on SQL databases. Not to brag, but I've also aced an internship in Web Development, where I honed my craft hands-on.

Curious about what's possible when technology meets creativity? Let's connect and explore the digital horizons together!
